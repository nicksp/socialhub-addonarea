    <h4>You can `introduce` new addons by clicking on `Create Addon` button in the top menu section, so that you can see Addons badge number update.</h4>
    <p>The logic is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you route to `Addons` page, we reset the number of new, unvisible addons.</li>
      <li>You can't add new addons (by clicking a button) when being on the `Addons` page. Since you are viewing all the new addons.</li>
